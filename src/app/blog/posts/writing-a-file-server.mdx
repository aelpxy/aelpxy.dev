This is a project with a story behind it. Not your average file server that just
serves files. It should handle everything with charm. (Still in progress)

## Why?

I do not know.

## Story

Okay, so all of this started exactly two years ago, on November 30, 2022. At the
time, I had a fairly good understanding of Go but didn't know how to build
production apps in Go yet. As far as I remember, I created a project called
`broccoli`. Shamelessly, I promoted it to my friend, hoping he would use it for
his production apps. Back then, it only had two routes: `[GET] /`,
`[POST] /upload`, `[GET] /:fileName`, if I remember correctly.

Yes, I didn't maintain it for two years straight, nor did I add any new
features. The last commit was made on March 31, 2023, and there was one earlier
on January 30, 2023, which was supposed to add TLS terminal support but that
never happened. It was kind of abandoned.

I renamed the project to serve after March 31, 2023, if I remember correctly.

Finally, on November 19, 2024, I decided to actively develop it again.

I came up with a new name because "`serve`" didn't seem like a good fit anymore.

The same friend who had previously reacted to the project seemed to like the new
ideas and architecture I had come up with. It should (_keep in mind, DO NOT use
this for production_) be able to serve low-traffic apps.

My first idea was to make it similar to AWS S3. I know it's not easy, and I
don't plan to replicate anything from S3, but I had a simple system and idea in
mind. So far, I've managed to get TLS working, and it looks pretty cool. It does
use a lot of dependencies, though.

```sh
Usage:
  fresh serve [flags]

Flags:
      --cert-dir string   Directory to store Let's Encrypt certificates (default "./certs")
  -d, --domain string     Domain name for the HTTP server
  -f, --folder string     Directory to serve files from (default "./")
  -h, --help              help for serve
  -p, --port string       Port to serve the HTTP server on (default "3000")
      --tls               Enable TLS for HTTPS server
```

Yes it can automatically issue Let's Encrypt certificates to your domain names.

```sh
$ fresh serve -f ./ -p 5000

9:40AM INFO fresh: launching server protocol=http address=:5000
9:40AM INFO fresh: incoming request method=GET path=/ ip=[::1]:55256 ua="cURL" proto=HTTP/1.1
9:40AM INFO fresh: request completed method=GET path=/ status=200 size="593 B" ip=[::1]:55256
```

## Designing the architecture

Just simple SQLite as the database, keeping in mind that this is a simple
project to learn more about various concepts. I want to keep things very
straightforward and easy to understand.

The following command will set up everything you need, including the API and
file server

```sh
$ fresh api --root=/var/fresh/data --domain=storage.aelpxy.dev
```

I'm also planning to add a config.toml configuration file, which will look
something like this

```toml
# storage config
[storage]
path = "/var/fresh/data"  # path to store data
chunk_size = 1024         # in bytes

# api config
[api]
domain = "storage.aelpxy.dev"     # domain to serve on
tls = "enabled"                   # TLS: enabled or disabled
web = true                        # web ui support (yes, there will be a web interface!)
jwt_secret = "aVerySecureSecret"  # JWT secret (should be encrypted with AES256)
aes_secret = "32bitsecret"        # secret key

# auth config
[auth]
username = ""                     # username for authentication
password = ""                     # password (accepts argon2 hash)

# web server config
[serve]
host = "0.0.0.0"                  # bind to all IP addresses
port = 5000                       # web server port (ignored if TLS is enabled)
folder = "./static-files"         # folder for static files
static_site = false               # enable static site serving (set to true for static apps)
tls = "enabled"                   # TLS: enabled or disabled
domain = "static.aelpxy.dev"      # static web server domain
cert_dir = "/var/fresh/certs"     # directory where TLS certificates will be stored

```

### Filesystem

```txt
/data/
  ├── storage.db # stores data about buckets and its objects
  └── assets/
       ├── metadata.msgpack # stores lookups and access keys
       ├── image.jpg
       └── icons/
             ├── img1.png
             └── img2.png
```

What's happening is that the root folder can contain multiple buckets, along
with a main `storage.db` file, which serves as the root SQLite database used to
store information about the buckets.

A `Bucket` is an actual folder on the system that stores metadata about objects
in `MessagePack` format, as well as the objects themselves. The `MessagePack`
file maps files and hashes for faster lookups. Each bucket contains objects,
which can be either a file or a folder.

The metadata for each object is stored in a corresponding `MessagePack` file
residing in the bucket, named `metadata.msgpack`.

It may seem like using `JSON` for storing the filesystem is the best idea, but
here's the thing: `JSON` is text-based, while `MessagePack` is binary. As a
result, `MessagePack` is typically faster and more compact to serialize and
deserialize compared to `JSON`.

`MessagePack` will provide better performance for large datasets, which we will
definitely deal with. There are also benefits in terms of space efficiency.
While it may not seem like a huge deal, large amounts of data can quickly take
up a significant amount of space.

## Moving forward

Maybe someday.
