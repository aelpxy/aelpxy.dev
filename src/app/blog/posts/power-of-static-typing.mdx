## Why should you care?

The developers who write dynamic languages always argue how easy it is to get
started. However, once they start using statically typed languages, it's
actually hard for them get back into dynamic languages. Languages like
JavaScript, Python (Python has Typehints for typesafety), and many others don't
care about type safety and thus throw really bad runtime errors if not handled
correctly.

While TypeScript is indeed a superset of JavaScript, it does type checking
during compile time, which in fact reduces the chances of a runtime error.
Modern languages like Rust and Go focus strictly on type safety (PS. Go isn't as
strict as Rust).

If you want to build solid software, static languages should be considered.
While many may argue that a lot of companies are using dynamic languages, and I
agree with them, they in fact do, but why would you want to waste time debugging
instead of just catching it during development? Doesn't it save more time than
having to debug in production?

## Preventing errors

Surely, the dynamic language advocates are thinking, 'I don't care.' But see the
benefits yourself, and once you get into static languages, I can bet you won't
want to go back to dynamic languages.

The problem:

```javascript
const user = await getUser(id)

console.log(user)
```

Everything looks fine, right? So, where's the issue? The issue is that you don't
know what the `getUser()` function returns. This may not be an issue in small
projects, but once you dive deeper into larger projects, this will become a
headache.

The solution:

```typescript
type UserType = 'user' | 'admin'

interface User {
  name: string
  email: string
  type: UserType
  isActive?: boolean
}

interface Error {
  message: string
  code: number
}

async function getUser(id: string): Promise<User | Error> {
  try {
    // perform the operation to fetch the user
    const userData = await fetchUserFromDatabase(id)

    if (!userData) {
      return {
        message: 'user was not foound',
        code: 404,
      }
    }

    return {
      name: userData.name,
      email: userData.email,
      type: userData.type,
      isActive: userData.isActive,
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      message: 'failed to fetch user',
      code: 500,
    }
  }
}
```

Perhaps that looks like a lot but if you trust me it will save you a lot of time
and headache in the future. Plus, you'll enjoy free autocompletion provided by
the language server.

## Conclusion

Initially, the setup may look like a lot of work, but once you get used to it,
it's an investment that will definitely pay off in the long run. You will thank
yourself in the future for taking the time to get this right. (Not joking - I'm
a victim of this myself.)
